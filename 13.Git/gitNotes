GitHub is a hosted repo (UI) for git or an open source SCM tools

Git 
====
Git tracks changes in files/codes/scripts 
Git keep the records of old and new using a commitID (command "git show")

Basic Git Commands 
==================
git init = used to initalize empty git repo (directory) in /home/USER/repoName/.git/

git status = used to track file locations

git add = moves files from the working area to the staging area 

git commit - m =  moves files to the local repository from Staging Area (good commit message for tracking changes/author)

git show = prints what changes that happened in a particular commit (any commitID)

git remote -v = lists your aliases 

git push = moves changes in code to Remote-Repo in SCM [GitHub/GitLab, ETC]

git pull = it brings changes in the code to the Working Area 

git stash = take backup 

git stash list = to view backups 

git stash apply = resume wip (work in progress) for the recent backup

git stash pop stash@{0} = it will apply & drop backup 1. 

git log = list all commits 

git show = shows changes that occured in a commit

git branch = a git branch is a line of development 

git fetch = it brings changes in the code to the LocalRepo 

git diff = reviews the difference between what is in the remoteRepo and localRepo Master branch. Allows you to review what files/changes a developer has made 

git clone = it brings the entire code to the Working Area (user access the code for the first time)

git branch = a git branch is a line of development 

git branch -d branchName = delete branch 

git checkout -b branchName = will create a branch and move developer into the branch that was created 
 
git cherry-pick = used to merge specific commit in a branch. Choose a commit from one branch and apply it onto another
 
 git merge = used to review and merge changes to one branch to another branch. combines however many commits into one merge. 
            git merge 
                sc1-->sc2-->sc3-->sc4 = mc1 
 
 git rebase = used to review and merge changes to one branch to another branch. Will separate each version/commit/changes by each                   commit 
               git rebase 
                 sc1-->sc2-->sc3-->sc4 = mc1 
                 = mc1-->mc2-->mc3-->mc4
 
 
 git origin = allows you to push all the changes to all the branches 
              origin = is the defualt aliasName created by git 
              
              git push origin --all 
              git push aliasName --all 
              git push aliasName master 
              git push aliasName stabe 
              git push aliasName development 
              
git head = is a pointer that points to the current branch and latest commit 
 
git clean -f = delete all files in the WA (working area)
              
git branch bug_fix_aaignee_jiraTicket# = removing bugs in the code landmark_145 = removing bugs in the code **created from the master branch**

git branch feature_aaignee_jiraTicket# = branch for adding new features **created from the master branch**

git tag:created only from the master branch . Tags are created for releases after a production cycle. When we use a tag we create a production  release. 
 
git commit --amend -m "an updated commit message" = Use this coomand to change the most recent Git commit message
       
git log --author="authorName" = Use this command to view the engineers commmits 
 

difference b/w tags and brnaches:
================================

git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global --list = to confirm the configs have been done 

visaRepo-url      = You Did 
Group12Repo-url   = TeamLead [write]

   mkdir visa && cd visa 
     git init 
     git remote add visa  visaRepo-url  
     git push visa master      
   mkdir group12 
     git init

     git branch dev_james
     git push g12 dev_james  

    git pull 
    
Commands to commit code versions to SCM in gitHub: 
==================================================
git add .      /  git add *

git clean -f 

git checkout -b branchName 

Command syntax legend: 
====================== 
 git branch = list all the branches [lines of development]
 git branch branchName = create a new branch 
 git checkout branchName = switches branches 
 git branch 
 git branch branchName
 git checkout branchName 
 git commit -a -m ts "comment"
 git checkout branchName 
 git diff branchName
 git merge branchName "reviewed and approved"
 git branch -d branchName 
 git cherry-pick
 git rebase 
 git branch push branchAlias --all = push all branches created CLI to remote repo
 
 CONFLCT are resloved manually when gitting error. The error stems from not       
 merging changes immediately approving the "diff".

 Note: Not best practice, merge all changes before switching branches. 
 Steps to resolve conflict:
 1. vi fileName (effected file to resolve by removing the changes reflected)
 2. git commit -a -m "conflict is resolved"

IDEs - Integrated Development Environments (developers use this to develop code)
================================================================================

Eclipse - open source Java Based IDE 
MyEclipse - not 
NetBeans OS Heavy 
Intellij - not 
Front - End 
        VS Code 
        Atom 
        Pycharm

When developers are creating files/writing code. There are additional files that will be added by using the IDEs. IDEs create these files and directories, but as a DevOps Engineer you can create them manually if needed. These files shouldn't be tracked by git because they are not apart of the project. In this case use 
the ".gitignore" file. 

 .classpath 
.project
node_modules 

1. vim .gitignore 
2. touch .classpath .project && mkdir node_modules
3. mv .classpath  .gitignore
4. mv .project .gitignore
5. git add .
6. git commit -m ".gitignore created"
7. git push ts master


Git Branching 
============= 
Branches are used to create lines of development. A branch is a line development. 

  Environments:
        development branch = deploying to Dev ENV 
        testing branch = deploys to Testing ENV 
        testing branch = deploys to UAT(QA, BA) ENV
        master branch = code are deployed to PROD        
        
 SSH Keys:
 =========
 cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub (verifies if the keys are available)
 ssh -T git@github.com
 ssh-keygen
 ssh-keygen -t dsa
 ls -la ~/.ssh
        id_rsa                private 
        id_rsa.pub            public
        known_hosts           hosts validated credentials 
        
ssh uses RSA encryption algorithm default. 

PAT
   Used to manage the GitHubAPI resources 
   Use to control access 
   Use to access GitHub account instead of password 
We can generate multiple PAT with different level of access 

Git Summary: 
============
Git is a distributed versions control system. We use git for Versioning in our projects. 

Git keeps/records changes made in codes/files/scripts. 

Basic Concepts: 
===============
    1. git installation 
         yum install git [RedHAT/centos]
         apt install git [unbuntu and debian]
         download microsoft installer file for git 
                 Git-2.37.2.2-64-bit.exe
                      git bash 
         
    2. git commands 
         git [init/add/commit -m/status]
         git pull/fetch/clone
         
    3. git branch 
         versioning is managed by git branches. Branch = line of development 
         git branches = DEV/STAGE/MASTER 
            git branch branchName (create)
            git branch -d branchName (delete)
            git checkout -b branchName (create and switch)
            git checkout branchName
            
    4. git tag
            
    5. git merge 
    
    6. pull requests (PR)
    
    7. git fetch

Interview Questions
====================

IQ: Which AtLassian tools have you used in your project?

Answer:
BitBucket ---> scm      = GitHub 
Bamboo ---> CI/CD       = Jenkins 
Jira ----> Ticketing tool = 
Confluence ---> Documentation


IQ: 
What are other SCM tools?

Answer: 
SCM: 
gitHub
gitLab 
bitbucket 
codeCommit 
 
IQ: 
Explain your branching strategy in LandmarkTechnology??
Explain your branching strategy in Dominion systems??
 
Answer: 
Branching is very important in Git, we use branching to create lines of   development. Having a good branching strategy is important when it comes to software delivery, development, and quality. 
 
In landmark we maintain a minimum of 3 branches -- staging, development, master. We makesure code from the development branch is deployed to the Dev Environment; code from the Stage Branch is deployed to the STAGE/uat/test/QA Environment; Master Branch code is deployed to the PRODUCTION Environment (delivered to customers).

If we notice bugs in the code we create a bug fix branch is created from the master. Once the bug is removed we have to create a pull request for other members of the team to review. If everything is correct it will be merged in the master branch. 
 
Similarly if the client wants us to add a new feature, we create the feature branch. The feature is created from the master branch and before it's merged there is a pull request. 

IQ: When should I use fetch, clone, and pull 

Answer: 
If you're already working on a project, then you're going to use either git fetch or git pull it will copy the changes from the remoteRepo into the localRepo. 
If you're new to the project then you will use git clone. 

IQ:
What is the difference between git commit and git rebase 

Answer: 
Git merge = merges commits together into to one commit 
Git rebase = merge commits independently 

IQ:
What is the best branching strategy 
Answer: 
  
   Development --> deploy to DEV ENV
   Staging --> deploy to UAT/Testing/QA (Pre-PROD)
   Master --> deploy PROD ENV
         Bugfix --> bugfix_bugNAME
         Feature 
         
Minium we maintain 3 branches -- DEV, STAGE, DEV. On top of Master if there's an issue we create a BugFix branch. If the client wants a particular    feature/modification we create a feature branch. 
   
IQ:
What is a README.md file
   
Answer: 
Often the first item a Developer will see in the repo. Typically include: 
   
  - What the project does 
  - Why the project is useful
  - Where users can get help with your project 
  - Who maintains and contributes to the project 
  
Getting Started 
================
Instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local   machine for development and testing. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system. 
  
Prerequisites 
=============
What things you need to install the software and how to install them Give examples 
  
Installing 
==========
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running. Say what the steps will be 
  
Running the tests 
=================
Explain how to run the automated tests for this system 
  
Deployment 
==========
Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system 
  
Versioning 
==========
Use versions for each release and keep track of versions 
  
Authors 
=======
Add here authors name 
  
License 
=======
add license here 
  
Git Best Practices
===================
Use branching strategy and pull requests
Commit once you finish the task
Avoid merge commits
Don't Commit Half-done code/work - git stash 
Test your code before commit 
Write Good Commit Messages before you are commiting 
Try to use git commands rather than GUI tools
Use ssh url and PAT over https 
Use rebase over git merge 

IQ: What are some Client HTTP status code errors?
4xx = Client Error 
      400 Bad Request 
      401 Unauthorized 
      402 Payment Required 
      403 Forbidden 
      404 Not Found 
      405 Method Not Allowed 
      406 Not Acceptable 
  
IQ: 
What is the difference between Git & Github?

Answer: 
Git is an open source DVS which records changes made to files (codes) laying emphasis on speed, data integrity in a distributed non-linear workflows.
